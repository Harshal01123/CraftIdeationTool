# Craft Ideation Tool (CIT)

CIT is a **full-fledged networking, learning, and commerce platform** aimed at promoting and advertising the crafts of **local artisans of Chhattisgarh**. The platform is envisioned as a blend of:

* 🎓 a **learning website** (courses, skill development, working under artisans)
* 🛒 an **e-commerce marketplace** (discovering and purchasing crafts)
* 🤝 a **networking platform** (connecting artisans, learners, and customers)
